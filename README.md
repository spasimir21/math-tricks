# Uix.js

This project uses a currently unfinished library of mine called **Uix.js**

I've wanted to make such a library for a long time and decided that this competition
is the perfect excuse to spend quite a bit of time on it. There are many features missing
because I have mainly focused on the things that I would need in order to make the game.
I hope that I can and will implement a lot of them in the future.

The library is built on the principles of fully reactive programming.
